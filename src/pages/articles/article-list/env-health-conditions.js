                    Environmental Health Conditions
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Environmental pollutants can cause health problems like respiratory diseases, heart disease, and some types of cancer. People with low incomes are more likely to live in polluted areas and have unsafe drinking water. And children and pregnant women are at higher risk of health problems related to pollution.
                    <br /><br />
                    Tracking environmental pollutants is key to figuring out where and how people are exposed. Laws and policies to reduce different types of pollution can also help prevent many serious health problems and deaths.

                <h2>Hayfever</h2>
                <p>Hay fever is usually worse between late March and September, especially when it's warm, humid and windy. This is when the pollen count is at its highest.</p>
                <p>
                    Symptoms of hay fever include:
                    <br /><br />
                    • sneezing and coughing<br />
                    • a runny or blocked nose<br />
                    • itchy, red or watery eyes<br />
                    • itchy throat, mouth, nose and ears<br />
                    • loss of smell<br />
                    • pain around your temples and forehead<br />
                    • headache<br />
                    • earache<br />
                    • feeling tired<br /><br />
                    If you have asthma, you might also:<br />
                    • have a tight feeling in your chest<br />
                    • be short of breath<br />
                    • wheeze and cough<br />
                    Hay fever will last for weeks or months, unlike a cold, which usually goes away after 1 to 2 weeks.
                    <br /><br />
                    Treatments:<br />
                    • put Vaseline around your nostrils to trap pollen<br />
                    • wear wraparound sunglasses to stop pollen getting into your eyes<br />
                    • shower and change your clothes after you have been outside to wash pollen off
                    • stay indoors whenever possible<br />
                    • keep windows and doors shut as much as possible<br />
                    • vacuum regularly and dust with a damp cloth
                    • buy a pollen filter for the air vents in your car and a vacuum cleaner with a HEPA filter<br />
                    • try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people if you have a high temperature or you do not feel well enough to do your normal activities<br />
                </p>

                <h2>Asthma</h2>
                <p>
                    Asthma is a common lung condition that causes occasional breathing difficulties.<br />
                    <br />
                    It affects people of all ages and often starts in childhood, although it can also develop for the first time in adults.<br />
                    <br />
                    There's currently no cure, but there are simple treatments that can help keep the symptoms under control so it does not have a big impact on your life.<br />
                    <br />
                    Symptoms of asthma<br />
                    The main symptoms of asthma are:<br />
                    <br />
                    • a whistling sound when breathing (wheezing)<br />
                    • breathlessness<br />
                    • a tight chest, which may feel like a band is tightening around it<br />
                    • coughing<br />
                    The symptoms can sometimes get temporarily worse. This is known as an asthma attack.<br />
                    <br />
                    Treatments for asthma<br />
                    Asthma is usually treated by using an inhaler, a small device that lets you breathe in medicines.<br />
                    <br />
                    The main types are:<br />
                    <br />
                    • reliever inhalers – used when needed to quickly relieve asthma symptoms for a short time<br />
                    • preventer inhalers – used every day to prevent asthma symptoms happening<br />
                    • Some people also need to take tablets.<br />
                    <br />
                    Causes and triggers of asthma<br />
                    Asthma is caused by swelling (inflammation) of the breathing tubes that carry air in and out of the lungs. This makes the tubes highly sensitive, so they temporarily narrow.<br />
                    <br />
                    It may happen randomly or after exposure to a trigger.<br />
                    <br />
                    Common asthma triggers include:<br />
                    <br />
                    • allergies (to house dust mites, animal fur or pollen, for example)<br />
                    • smoke, pollution and cold air<br />
                    • exercise<br />
                    • infections like colds or flu<br />
                    Identifying and avoiding your asthma triggers can help you keep your symptoms under control.<br />
