            <h2>What are extreme weather events?</h2>
            <p>
                Extreme weather is when a weather event is significantly different from the average or usual weather pattern. This may take place over one day or a period of time.
            </p>

            <h3>Heatwaves</h3>
            <p>
                Extreme heat, in the form of this phenomenon that involves high temperatures lasting for several days, has become increasingly frequent and intense in the majority of the Earth's regions since 1950, according to the IPCC's report.
            </p>
            <h3>Cold Snaps</h3>

            <p>
                Unlike heatwaves, this phenomenon, which involves several days of low temperatures, has become less frequent, according to the IPCC. However, this does not mean the end of unusual situations, such as Storm Philomena, which brought Spain to a standstill for several days.
            </p>
            <h3>Cyclones</h3>
            <p>
                According to the IPCC, these have become more frequent over the last four decades. Furthermore, they are proving more destructive as they result in higher category hurricanes. All of this could well be related with an increase of the surface temperature of the sea.
            </p>
            <h3>Drought</h3>
            <p>
                The lack of rain in certain areas of the world, such as the Horn of Africa, is increasingly pronounced, thereby prolonging this phenomenon and forcing thousands of people to emigrate and become climate refugees. In addition, water scarcity can also result in violent clashes.
